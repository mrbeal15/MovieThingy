# Visitors to the site can browse by genre or search for a specific movie. If they do not have an account, they can read reviews, but cannot comment, or rate a review.
# To comment and rate reviews, users must create an account and log in.
# Once logged in, users can comment on reviews, and rate them on a scale of 1-5. Five indicates an outstanding review, and one indicates a review of little substance.
# When rating a review, users can see the review's current average rating as well as the rating they are assigning.
# Once a user has made at least three submissions that have an average rating of 4 or higher, with a minimum of three high scores/submission, they are deemed to be a "trusted" user.
# Trusted user reviews can post without community oversite.
# Reviews from all other users must be vetted before they can be posted.
# If a trusted users' overall ratings total falls below 4, they will be reverted back to a standard user.
# User type can be admin, trusted, or standard.
