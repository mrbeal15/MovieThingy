Phase 3 - Client Project

## Purpose
This project was conceived to create an elegant website for publishing movie reviews. It allows a user to publish a review, and will allow other users to rate said review. Upon a high enough rating, the review will be moved to the top of the page. Once a reviewer has enough points, all reviews they right will be placed in the higher part of the page.
